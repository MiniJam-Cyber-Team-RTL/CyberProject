Misc. Authors Info      : We are a team of 3 french students in 
			  game devloppment of the UQAC 
			  (Universitée du Quebec a Chicoutimi) 
			  set in the region of Quebec in Canada.

			  This is our first year at the Uni and our first
			  experience about making a videogame 
			  (and for 2 of us, the first time opening Godot)
			  So please bear in mind that we had about 0 
			  experience in gaming before

			  

Description             : This is a game made in 72h for the minijam 167
			  with the theme of cyber and the limitation of
			  one button, two actions.

			  The concept (or the one we had in mind in the first 
			  place, but didn't have the time to implement it fully)
			  is that the player's wife is kidnapped and he must 
			  travel 3 levels to find her, in a 2D platformer way.

			  But the twist to it to respect the limitation is
			  that the player resolve any problem with his bare arms
			  so the "interactions" like open a door, hack a terminal
			  climb a lader, push a button… is done by punching everything

			  Sadly 2 levels were scrapped and most of the puzzle elements 
			  are not here, so it's just a generic 2D platformer
				
			  But the most important of all is that we had a lot of fun
			  and we learned a lot of it and it mark the begining
			  of us making games, that hopefully will be better and
			  coded cleanly
